# Swarm Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered across iterations - READ THIS FIRST)

- Use `visible` prop on R3F objects, never conditional render for visibility
- Flat scene graph (array) is better than tree for undo/redo in editors
- Check for existing files before creating new ones when agents run in parallel
- TypeScript + Vite build verification is the final quality gate before phase-complete

---

## Phase 1 - Project Scaffold (COMPLETE)
- Vite + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS 4 + React Three Fiber 9
- 3D viewport with western theme (desert ground, sunset environment, earthy palette)
- Object CRUD: add/remove/duplicate 6 primitives (box, sphere, cylinder, cone, plane, torus)
- Transform gizmos (translate, rotate, scale via Drei TransformControls)
- Undo/redo with snapshot history
- Save/load scene serialization with migration support
- Keyboard shortcuts (Q/W/E/R, Delete, Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y, Ctrl+D)
- TypeScript and Vite build pass clean
